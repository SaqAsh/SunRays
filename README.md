# SunRays - Interactive Raytracing Simulation

A real-time raytracing demonstration built in C using SDL2. Features an interactive light source that casts 500 rays in all directions, with dynamic obstacle collision detection.

## Features

- **Interactive light source** - Drag with mouse to move the light
- **Dynamic obstacle** - Bouncing circle that blocks rays
- **Real-time ray casting** - 500 rays with collision detection
- **Smooth 60+ FPS rendering** - Optimized distance calculations

## Build & Run

```bash
make run          # Build and run
```

## Controls

- **Mouse drag** - Move light source
- **ESC/Close window** - Exit

## Technical Details




- Written in C with SDL2 for graphics
- Efficient collision detection using squared distances
- Real-time ray casting with 500 rays
- ~62.5 FPS rendering with frame rate limiting
